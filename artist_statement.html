            <h1>artist statement</h1>
            <p>I am an only child from southern Humboldt county. Growing up in an isolated rural area developed my passion for the environment at a young age. I am currently an environmental studies major and do not consider myself to be an artist, however I enjoy sharing my perspective through the work I produce. Living miles away from my friends and local resources like grocery stores, I would learn and create most things on my own. In high school I would write graffiti, poetry, and rap to convey my unique perspective, and as I continued into college I refined these crafts. I currently design clothes, record music, and produce instrumentals from my bedroom. Maintaining the do-it-yourself mindset I grew up with, I do not produce work for money or my peers. I simply create for myself. To make myself happy. To make things I enjoy and develop skills and pieces I believed I was previously incapable of. I am inspired by people like Basquiat, Lil B, and members of the Wu-Tang Clan and their portrayal of emotions and perspective through unrefined and improvised creation. In my own music I carry over this inspiration through freestyling vocals, writing in a stream of consciousness style, and recording vocals with less intention on quality than the overall emotions and feeling. Once again, I am not an artist. I am just a kid from Humboldt county with a unique perspective on myself and the world that surrounds me. I would like you to get a better understanding of myself and personal experience through viewing my work.
